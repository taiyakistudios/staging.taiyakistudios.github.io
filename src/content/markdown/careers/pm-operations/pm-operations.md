## Summary:

We are looking for a project manager to help us scale and build in best practices for client partnerships and internal development as we build out our virtual content engine. Your job will be to support the internal cadence as we develop the tools and content, and ensure we are communicating and sharing with our partners within tight timelines.

## Context:

Our product just went live with our first partner [YBGhosty](https://www.instagram.com/ybghosty/) - all his posts were created using our pipeline - and we are ready to scale it to more creators!

As an early stage startup with early signs of product market fit, the founders are overwhelmed and can only wear so many hats as we work to scale our offerings as fast as possible.

## Responsibilities:

Help us stay afloat as we scale.

We are currently onboarding a new partner every couple of weeks, and we’d like to up that cadence to multiple per week. This will require creating new processes to onboard partners, sync internal teams on deliverables for them, and maintain forward momentum on partnered projects.

We are also rolling out the first iteration of our AI product to partners and will need your support in maintaining feedback loops between partners and our AI product team.

Daily: your role will focus on project management coordinating across our internal tech teams & our partners who are using our product and constantly pushing us to improve it.

Weekly: there may be some light office management to support our partners who come in to record at our SF studio - e.g. making sure our equipment is ready to go.

Monthly: there will be some light admin work - e.g. filing paperwork in a state where we’ve hired a new remote team member.

## Requirements:

- Experience with managing multiple projects and implementing best practice processes across the system.
- You’ve experienced early stage startup chaos or similar environments.
- You are extremely organized and a strong written communicator.
- Experience with ClickUp, Asana, Trello, or similar task management system.

## Nice to have:

- Experience working with remote teams.
- Experience with Hubspot or similar CRM.
