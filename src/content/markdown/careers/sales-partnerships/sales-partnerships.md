**Your job:** Find virtual creators like Mia, Sakiko, Harles, and Eric V Tuber (we have already reached out to all of them). Reach out to understand their ambitions and pain points. If they are a good fit for Taiyaki’s offerings and aligned with our vision, you’d pass them off to one of the founders for them to close the partnership.

**Context:** Our product just went live with our first partner [YBGhosty](https://www.instagram.com/ybghosty/) - all his posts were created using our pipeline - and we are ready to scale it to more creators!

**Who we are targeting:** Content creators who have already launched a virtual character but don’t have the resources/tech in place to create animated content or livestreams with their character:

_All not Taiyaki partners, though we’d love to work with them_

[Mia Irl](https://www.instagram.com/mia/), and [Sakiko](http://www.instagram.com/sakikoisntreal/) - virtual instagrammers, but only have static content. Taiyaki could allow them to create Tiktoks & livestream.

[Harles Mac VR](https://www.instagram.com/harlesmac_vr/), popular metaverse rapper (yes actually!), has no easy way to use his avatar to make Tiktok/livestream content.

[Eric V. Tuber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRz_NltHdTwiHbG9H7u-Jmg), a creator dabbling with livestreaming but who doesn’t yet have a working setup or his own custom character. Taiyaki can provide both.

**Why it matters:** Virtual characters allow creators to express themselves limited only by their creativity, not their connections or looks. Help us empower the next generation of talent with cutting edge tech that is currently out of their reach.
