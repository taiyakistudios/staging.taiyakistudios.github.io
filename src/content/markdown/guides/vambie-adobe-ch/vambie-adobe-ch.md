Thank you for downloading our 2D motion capture Vambie models for Adobe Character Animator.

To begin using your characters, first follow these quick and simple steps:

---

## Step 1

Please make sure you have installed the Adobe Character Animator program.

## Step 2

Locate where you have downloaded your Vambie zip file to on your system. Once you unzip the file you will find a folder called ‘CH Promode and Startermode…’. Inside are two folders, one called Pro mode and one called Starter mode. Adobe character animator has a free version available and if you are using this, then please select the starter model. If you are using Adobes Pro mode (a subscription service with a trial period available), then choose the Pro folder. Inside either folder you will find a file with a purple CH icon. Simply double click on this and it will open up automatically in Adobe Character Animator.

## Additional

We have produced a step by step video guide that explains how you can use your model in Adobe character animator. If for any reason you cannot see the link to that video on this page, then inside your file folder you will find a PDF readme file which has a direct link. The PDF also has information about Adobe's free Starter mode, as well as more information about the Vambies.

We look forward to seeing your Vambie animations, please do send them to us on our Discord page at https://discord.gg/taiyaki
