Once the ‘Live2DModels’ folder is open, paste in the folder for the Vambie Avatar that you downloaded from the Taiyaki Avatar Selection page. Make sure that the downloaded file has been unzipped.

Restart Vtube studio. Once again select the top Avatar icon. This time when the panel appears, you should see your avatar available for selection. Select it and enjoy.

Navigate your way to the Vtubestudio folder, and then to the Live2DModels folder inside of it. This is where you saved your zip file. When you locate your saved file, hold your finger on it until a pop up appears:
