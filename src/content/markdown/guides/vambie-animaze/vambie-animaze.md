Tap the “Save to Files” option.

Then select “On My iPhone” and find the “Animaze” folder. Save the file in the Animaze folder.

In Animaze, navigate to the “Avatars” tab and then the “Avatars” tab again (that’s right, the “Avatars” tab has another tab also called “Avatars” inside of it) and you will find your Vambie under “Imported Avatars”. If it doesn’t appear, restart Animaze.

## Creating Content

The home screen on iOS Animaze has video recording and photo options. Before you start, tap the ‘Calibrate’ option in the top left of the screen to ensure optimal facial animation.

Navigate to the `.avatar` file you downloaded from Taiyaki Studios and you should be good to go!

Before recording, click the calibrate button to ensure optimal facial capture.

If this is your first time livestreaming, click the “Enable Virtual Camera” button in the center-bottom of the screen and follow the “Learn to Stream” tutorial provided by Animaze.
