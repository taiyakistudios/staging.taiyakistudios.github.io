  **What we do:** Taiyaki Studios serves creators who use virtual characters to express themselves - commonly known as VTubers or virtual influencers. We serve as a tech-enabled talent agency, providing top creators with the tech, community, and mentorship they need to scale their audiences. 

  Some examples of creators powered by Taiyaki: [YBGhosty](https://www.instagram.com/ybghosty/), a virtual influencer, and [the Vambies](https://vambie.com), a virtual character collective. 

  **What we believe:** The next Marvel-scale IP will be born as a collective of virtual characters on social media. Our end goal is to grow massive fandoms for collectives of virtual characters and leverage that IP for Marvel-scale monetization - merchandising, tv, film, games, etcâ€¦

  A revolution in content creation is upon us: advancements in AI, motion capture, and game engines have enabled solo creators to animate 3d characters in their bedroom at higher quality than large studios could just a few years ago. 

  These advancements will turbocharge artistic & cultural output by giving a platform to creators of all backgrounds, limited only by their talent & creativity rather than their connections or looks. We seek to set the bar as the most creator friendly VTuber/Virtual Influencer company in the market. 

  **Who are we?** Well-funded by top VCs (before the market crashed ðŸ˜…), our team is a mix of Silicon Valley engineers, 3D artists/content creators, and a music industry veteran who launched the careers of a couple of the worldâ€™s top rappers thrown in for good measure.
